# Weather Predictor

We used supervised Machine learning techniques to predict the weather forecast. We also provide a GUI for users to get predictions for their locations.

## Installation

#### modules Included

- pandas
- sklearn
- tkinter
- Inbuilt - os, datetime

## Usage

**Cities We are going to predict are : Pune, Delhi, Bombay, Hyderabad,Jaipur,Nagpur,bengaluru,kanpur**

1. For running the application you need to run the final.py
2. The depending files for final.py to run are predictions.py, ending with -coef.csv files
3. Make sure that the mentioned files are in same folder or else adjust the path to the files accordingly
   [pandas file path](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#:~:text=filepath_or_bufferstr%2C%20path,table.csv.)

### Data Set

we made our data set from [IMD-CDSP](https://cdsp.imdpune.gov.in/home_gridded_data.php)
